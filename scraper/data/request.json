The funding is intended to cover expenses from April 1 to July 30, 2024, and is aimed at stabilizing the rice and sugar industries. However, there were disagreements during the approval process, particularly regarding the allocation for the sugar industry. The sugar industry has been facing financial difficulties, with GuySuCo recording losses of $7.8 billion in 2021 and $10.2 billion in 2022. The government is also facing challenges in managing the Guyana Rice Development Board's finances due to a temporary reduction in commission rates. Despite these issues, the rice sector appears resilient, with production holding steady. However, rising prices for white and brown rice are causing concerns. The government is defending the request from the Contingency Fund, addressing concerns about the reopening of GuySuCo estates and financial management. They noted that the Albion estate has faced electrical issues, while the Rose Hall estate processed over 2,000 tonnes of sugar, generating revenue at the average price of US$750 per tonne. Despite ongoing financial difficulties, rehabilitation efforts include a $600 million investment to repair the Albion factory powerhouse. The Guyana Rice Development Board, another crucial player in Guyana\u2019s agricultural arena, has been plunged into financial difficulties due to a temporary 25% reduction in commission rates designed to aid millers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This move, intended to stabilize paddy prices, has instead led to a severe financial shortfall, with the GRDB having to forgo its commission entirely. Paddy prices surged from $4000 to $4500 per bag between April and August 2024, exacerbating the GRDB\u2019s financial strain. As the GRDB scrambles to restore its finances, questions were raised by the opposition. \u201cWhy was $524 million suddenly needed and not in February\u2019s budget?\u201d Opposition MP Vinceroy Jordan demanded answers, questioning the unexpected financial strain and the GRDB\u2019s ability to manage its growing staff of 250. Mustapha attributed the crisis to unforeseen challenges, including a new paddy bug threat and complications from El Ni\u00f1o. With rice production holding steady, up from 610,000 tonnes to 653,000 tonnes, the sector appears resilient despite mounting issues, according to Mustapha. Yet, rising prices for white and brown rice are fueling opposition concerns. Mustapha said that the increases are market-driven rather than supply-related, insisting that the government cannot enforce price controls on supermarkets.",

The International Labor Organization has declared a \"safe and healthy working environment\" a fundamental right, but many countries have yet to extend these protections to informal workers. The article suggests that urgent reforms are needed to labor-protection frameworks to ensure the health, safety, and livelihoods of informal workers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where informal jobs account for 90% of total employment. The article also discusses the challenges in addressing this issue, including the self-employed status of many informal workers and the disconnect between local and national policymakers.
