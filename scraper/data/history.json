            "Dear Editor,",
            "It has been at least three months now that works started to widen the eastern half of Sixth Street, Cummings Lodge from the Hindu Temple to the Secondary School. It must be noted this is not a normal straight street but a long winding road connection this village to Industry. Works done so far are digging along both sides of the road, sand-filling and laying stones at the top.",
            "Editor, for the past month or so no work has been done. Residents including hundreds of schoolchildren have had to endure a lot of inconvenience as they were forced to traverse this part of the road with loose stones all around.",
            "To add insult to injury, last Saturday I observed that similar works started on the part of the road from the Temple to UG Road. I got angry and went straight to the work site to get some information from the staff. Editor I was shocked with the answer I got. The gentleman with a Trinidadian accent explained that they had asphalted the eastern half already but the Government has not tested the area for solidity as yet. He gave the name of the Engineering Company as what sounded like Aramco.",
            "Editor if this revelation of this site worker is accurate then it is clear that not only Contractors default on projects but the Government can be negligent of their responsibilities as well.",
            "Editor, when you listen to the hierarchy of this Government you would want to believe that they are perfect and always put the people first but in reality and on the ground it is far from so. Look at the project to repair part of UG Road from the Railway Embankment to the Seawall that was left in a mess. Look at the new Vryheid\u2019s Lust Primary School where no work was done to complete this building during the August Break in 2023 but soon after the resumption of classes in September works restarted resulting in students being exposed to a series of health and safety hazards. That is probably why the school was never commissioned.",
            "Editor, there are so many instances where the Government\u2019s incompetencies are exposed and if citizens continue to accept quantity instead of quality then monies including our hard-earned taxes we pay will continue to be wasted.",
            "Yours faithfully,",
            "R. Khan"

        "date": "2024-10-08T02:01:40-04:00",
        "paragraphs": [
            "It is conceivable that it would not have occurred to many Guyanese residing on \u2018the coastal plain\u2019 that both children and teachers in parts of the hinterland must endure the safety and health hazards as well as the indignity that attends the need to use pit latrines outside of schools\u2019 and, seemingly, that there appears not to exist, up to this time, any immediate-term plan to remove this unacceptable obstacle to the delivery of education in a convivial environment in those areas. Here, and even as there may well occur a further vigorous and wider verbal discourse over this disturbing disclosure, the immediate priority must be to have these health and safety hazards\u00a0 removed over as brief a period as possible, beginning immediately, and replaced by flush toilets.",
            "It is apposite to wonder whether the announcement in August by Education Minister, Priya Manickchand, that government is in the process of \u2018transitioning\u2019 pit latrines to flush toilets in hinterland areas will be accelerated now that the issue has been placed prominently in the public domain.",
            "Incidentally, the outbreak of a political \u2018blame game\u2019 is an altogether inappropriate response to this disclosure. Hinterland development \u2013 which includes the installation of sanitation requisites \u2013 ought to have been occurring incrementally, over time, so that by now there ought to have been some evidence of an upgrade in areas of hygiene and sanitation. On the other hand, it can be argued that by now, the availability of petro dollars would have allowed for much more expeditious expenditure on requisites associated with the safety and health of children (and their teachers) attending schools in hinterland regions.",
            "One issue that arises here has to do with whether, the incumbent administration, possessed of its petro resources, ought not to have made more headway in fixing this problem. Truth be told, it is taking an unacceptably protracted period to at least begin the process of bringing \u2018flush\u2019 toilets to schools in the hinterland. It should be said that what the Minister of Education had to say on this matter (Education Ministry surveying how many schools still have pit latrines: Stabroek News August 28, 2024) does not come even remotely close to getting to the core of it. Given the importance of replacing pit latrines with flush toilets, the process should have begun some time ago.",
            "To go further, the fact that there appears not to have been, up to this time, some kind of concrete plan to incrementally remove pit latrines from schools in the interior does not reflect well on the Ministry of Education despite what the Minister of Education had to say in her interview with the Stabroek News about the education system having been decentralized so that, \u201cas such schools are managed by the regional governance system.\u201d One would not have thought that decentralization would have removed the vested interest of the Ministry to stay engaged with procedures and processes that have to do with the development of those facilities associated with the advancement of the education system.",
            "One anticipates that questions will arise in some quarters as to whether there are not wider considerations associated with the installation of modern loos (the plural of loo, an informal British expression for toilet) including costs (which surely ought to be the lesser consideration) and technical/physical constraints (many of the locations where these pit latrines are situated are likely not to have access to \u2018running\u2019 water at this time) though the thought of these health hazards/actual danger to life and limb persisting for much longer is surely unthinkable and that whatever the costs (and effort) associated with upgrading, the exercise of removing and replacing these \u2018pit latrines\u2019 ought to be addressed with maximum alacrity.",
            "It has to be said, further, that the functionaries responsible, directly, for delivering education in those areas where pit latrines are still \u2018in vogue\u2019 must commence the exercise of speaking out now that the issue is out in the open. In the circumstances, arriving at \u2018a figure\u2019 for the replacement of pit latrines ought not to be (as we say in Guyana) \u2018a day\u2019s work.\u2019 The point to be made here is that the issue of pit latrines at hinterland schools is just the kind of revelation that might \u2018blow over,\u2019 after an initial \u2018hoo-ha.\u2019 This might well result in the issue of pit latrines becoming sidelined. After all, and for all the historic denial, issues to do with the well-being of hinterland communities have always appeared to be treated as lesser concerns. That is, at least, how it usually appears.",
            "We should remind ourselves that we have only just had to endure a horrendous tragedy resulting from a fire in a Dormitory at an interior location that claimed a number of lives on account of what was widely felt to be, in large measure, a lack of official mindfulness in the matter of the safety of the children occupying the facility. In the extant instance of the pit latrines, as in the case of the Mahdia Dormitory Fire, it appears that the potential for tragedy that may range from the collapse of a pit latrine resulting in loss of life to outbreaks of pockets of diseases (if these may not have occurred already) may have an even more long-term harmful effect than the Mahdia Dorm Tragedy.",
            "One assumes that, hopefully, the pit latrines \u2018audit\u2019 which, presumably would have been ensuing for some time and would have come to an end by now (on the surface, at least, it does not appear to be an overwhelmingly weighty task) and that the numbers are on the Minister\u2019s desk. This, one feels, should be sufficient to cause the process leading to the installation of flush toilets at schools across the hinterland to begin without further undue delay."

        "date": "2024-08-04T02:19:43-04:00",
        "paragraphs": [
            "The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) is taking the government to task for failing to insulate the environment and Indigenous communities from the negative effects of gold mining and makes the case that the many benefits it accords the sector do little to encourage responsible action.",
            "In a release yesterday, GHRA referenced the recent statement from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MoNR) which catalogued the extensive perks, concessions and privileges extended to the gold-mining sector, including tax reductions, duty-free concessions, simplified licensing arrangements, expansion of available mining properties in conflicted areas such as Marudi Mountains, and removal of protective regulations. All this, the Association added, without mentioning the \u201chuge environmental and human cost\u201d perpetrated by this industry. It was noted too that the ministry\u2019s statement concluded with a reminder that this unwavering support was \u201cin keeping with the ruling party Manifesto prior to the last elections.\u201d Further, the GHRA bemoaned the fact that even road-building in interior regions has become mining-driven rather than influenced by community or environmental considerations.\u00a0 ",
            "\u00a0The release pointed out that since all mining has a significant effect on the environment, the Environmental Protection Act 1996, (Section 11) and Schedule 4, (item 9) mandates that Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Environmental Permits (EP) are to be undertaken for each and every mining operation. However, according to the annual reports of the Guyana Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (GY-EITI), the Guyana Geology & Mines Com-mission (GGMC) has not enforced such requirements for many years for the thousands of small-scale mining claims or medium-scale mining permits covering millions of hectares.\u00a0",
            "GHRA lamented the fact that most of Guyana\u2019s prized large rivers have been reduced to health and safety hazards by gold mining, with river banks and the actual course of rivers having been altered by illegal hydraulic mining. Added to this is the failures to apply the several GGMC Codes of Practice to the waste in mine tailings now spilling polluted sediment into the creeks and rivers. \u201cNo effort has been made to apply penalties for these transgressions despite the fact that River Navigation Act (cap. 50:01, 1998) and the State Lands Act 1903/1972 (Section 22) states \u2018Everyone who willfully causes any impediment to the free use or navigation of any river or navigable creek, shall be liable to a fine of ninety-seven thousand five hundred dollars, unless he has previously obtained permission under this Act or the Forests Act to cause the impediment.\u2019\u201d",
            "It is the contention of the Association that mining disrupts riverine ecosystems, leading to habitat destruction, reduced water quality, and the loss of bio-diversity, which makes it imperative that the EIA process \u201cbe consistently, rigorously and transparently applied.\u201d And although regular and thorough inspections, coupled with stringent penalties for non-compliance are required, they are currently ignored given the understaffing of the GGMC.",
            "The difficulty here, the GHRA said is that a handful of field Mines Officers and Wardens are expected to monitor an industry which has issued thousands of mining claims, and penalties for breaches of the various rules and regulations do not disincentivize breaches. As such there is a need for penalties to be much more severe, while prioritising the restoration of mining sites and enforcing robust environmental regulations and this can mitigate long-term environmental damage, protect vital water resources, and promote sustainable development.",
            "The release referred to an experiment undertaken by the GGMC some years ago to assess the cost of mine-site restoration. It was discovered that the cost of a small-scale restoration by a contracted company was estimated to be in the region of $6 million as compared to the \u201cderisory\u201d sum of $100,000 for restoration \u2013 the obligatory environmental bond \u2013 which is treated by the majority of miners as payment to the GGMC to get the job done.",
            "Moving on to the negative effects of mining on Indigenous communities, the release noted that longstanding claims by Indigenous communities are aggravated by land ownership policies, which have been progressively dominated since colonial times by the mineral potential of lands rather than ownership claims. \u00a0",
            "Quiet enjoyment\n\u201cThe most severe consequences of the free-for-all in the mining sector are felt by Amerindian communities who have seen their land rights progressively eroded despite the catalogue of Statutes and Regulations that provide a legal defence.\u00a0 Amerindian rights to \u2018quiet enjoyment of their land and surroundings\u2019 have trumped any mining claims in a series of laws. The Mining Regula-tion of 1905 stated \u2018All land occupied or used by the Aboriginal Indians, and all land necessary for the quiet enjoyment by the Aboriginal Indians of any Indian settlement, shall be deemed to be lawfully occupied by them\u2019(Section 199). Virtually the same language is reproduced in the Mining Act 1989 (Section 111) and similarly reproduced in the Water and Sewerage Act Cap. 30-01 2002 (Section 94).\u201d",
            "The GHRA therefore, feels strongly that this \u201cquiet enjoyment\u2019 clause ought to constitute a deterrent to the GGMC\u2019s issuance of small-scale mining claims or medium-scale mining permits before a due diligence check is completed in each requested area in or including a titled Amerindian Village (required in section 53 of the Amerindian Act 2006). However, it made sure to point out that in practice, as shown in the High Court cases in 2009 (Arau Village) and 2012-3 (Isseneru Village), such checks appear not to have been made and mining concessions have been issued by the GGMC over titled and untitled Amerindian lands without the knowledge of the Amerindian communities.",
            "The release homed in on mercury which is used in the gold recovery process and is known to pollute aquatic life, increase mortality and reproductive failures, and disrupts food chains. Here the government was criticised for not making enough effort to reduce the incidence and scale of mercury methylation into the environment and food chain, as well as taking the urgent remedial action the situation merits.",
            "Mention was made of a study undertaken in 2008 of mercury use by both terrestrial and river based hydraulic dredges where the amount estimated used annually was 11.37 tonnes. It referenced data that showed that official imports peaked in 2011 at 5.4 times the national requirement and grew to an estimated 35.82 tonnes in 2013. Over this period total imports were 504 tonnes with an excess of approximately 355 tonnes, which is 10 years\u2019 worth of demand at 2013 levels. It also noted the allegation that much of this mercury is smuggled into Suriname where importation of mercury has been prohibited.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cEnvironmental neglect and human suffering, together with bio-diversity and wildlife loss, is not even considered a cost by the gold industry or government.\u00a0 These costs should\u00a0be added to legal and illegal export of profits from gold mining, at no benefit whatever to their sovereign owners \u2013 the citizens of Guyana. In these circumstances the rationale for government subsidies to this industry requires urgent explanation. Moreover, they represent a stark contradiction to the Low Carbon Development Strategy 2030 (LCDS 2030) which figures prominently in government speeches at overseas events\u201d, the GHRA said."

        "paragraphs": [
            "The week before last the Ministry of Natural Resources issued a press release on mining.\u00a0 It was a strange statement clearly directed at miners, but whose purpose for all of that was not immediately apparent. The release said that it wanted to advise that \u201cillegal mining activities will not be tolerated and is calling on all miners to follow the prescribed process to legitimize their operations.\u201d\u00a0 The Ministry went on to urge \u201c[t]hose who are engaging in such activities [to] desist, or risk being prosecuted by the state.\u201d Given the record of mining oversight in this country, it was not a threat which would have left members of that community shaking in their boots.",
            "Having divested itself of the obligatory warning, the Ministry went on to assure small and medium-scale miners that it remained \u201ceager to foster greater collaboration\u201d with them in order \u201cto ensure the sector remains a viable one.\u201d\u00a0 In other words the authorities by implication opened themselves to the interpretation that miners could ignore the warnings, because there was no intention at the political level of putting a brake on their operations. As if to reinforce that construction of their words, the remainder of the statement itemised at some length all the measures the government had taken to facilitate miners, and had nothing to say about any proposals it might have to deal with \u201cillegal mining activities.\u201d",
            "It is more than likely that all it had in mind with respect to illegalities in any case were the issues surrounding gold-smuggling after the allegations against the Mohammeds and Permanent Secretary Mae Toussaint Jnr Thomas came to light two months ago. Following that revelation various measures were announced relating to business being conducted in the interior and entities trading in vulnerable minerals, but these were not accompanied by anything addressing the myriad other issues pertaining to the mining sector.\u00a0",
            "As such, the press release listed a litany of benefits the PPP/C government had provided for miners such as the removal of VAT on various items, the dispensing with police clearance to transport fuel in their vehicles and the abolition of excise tax on a number of things. Then there was the support afforded by the provision of properties through lotteries and in other ways.",
            "If all of this was indeed intended as a comfort statement for miners, last week the GHRA stepped in to remind the government and the public about the cost of uncontrolled mining on the environment, the ecosystem, the Indigenous people and the country as a whole. With reference to all the benefits for miners enumerated in the statement the Association said this did little to encourage responsible action.",
            "And where illegalities were concerned, the GHRA adverted to the fact that a handful of field Mines Officers and Wardens were charged with monitoring an industry involving thousands of claims. In addition to that the penalties for breaches of the regulations did nothing to persuade people to conform to the rules, and that as it was, these needed to be far more severe.",
            "Anyone who has ever been into the mining areas of the interior \u2013 and even those peripheral to the mining areas \u2013 knows that the GHRA is not exaggerating. Since the majority of our population is based on the coast, and aside from the odd trip to Bartica or Kaieteur Falls, has little or no first-hand acquaintance with what goes on in the hinterland, its members are content to accept the government\u2019s oft-quoted and self-satisfied remark that Guyana has preserved most of its forest intact.",
            "What has been preserved is mostly courtesy of the Amerindians, but some of them are under serious pressure from mining. Where conflicts arise, even when under the 2006 Amerindian Act an Indigenous community has the law on its side, mining interests invariably win out. To quote the Association: \u201cThe most severe consequences of the free-for-all in the mining sector are felt by Amerindian communities who have seen their land rights progressively eroded despite the catalogue of Statutes and Regulations that provide a legal defence.\u201d",
            "The scandalous case of Chinese Landing has received a lot of public exposure, as has to a lesser degree, for example, Isseneru and villages in the vicinity of Marudi Mountain. Some communities such as the first-named have had recourse to the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and/or the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. These international agencies insist on the Indigenous right to Free Prior and Informed Consent, a habit not ingrained in the government, which views itself as conferring goodies of one kind or another, not consulting on decisions, never mind if these aid a community or do the opposite.",
            "The problem is that any demographic is seen by the government in electoral terms, and both the miners and the Amerindians are important in their own way in this regard. The difference is that Freedom House thinks it can control the Indigenous population, whereas the miners, who have in the past been seen as a PNCR constituency but are now not necessarily still so, have to be persuaded with \u2018benefits\u2019. In addition to this, small and medium-scale mining provides a profitable living for coastlanders who otherwise would possibly be unemployed and therefore potential troublemakers, while gold for its part is an important export commodity.",
            "The PPP\u2019s myopic vision in relation to the interior has caused enormous environmental and ecological damage as described by GHRA. It might be mentioned in this connection that when this newspaper went into the Marudi mining area three years ago, we found that the miners had effectively decapitated Mazoa Mountain, which was close to disappearing from the physical maps of Guyana altogether. But it is not even mountains which are the main problem, according to the Association, since Guyana\u2019s large rivers have become health and safety hazards because of gold mining, while in the case of other rivers their banks and courses have been altered by hydraulic mining.",
            "With the failure to observe several GGMC codes of practice, polluted tailings are spilling into the rivers and creeks in defiance of the law. Then there is the disruption to riverine ecosystems, said the GHRA, with the destruction of habitats and loss of biodiversity, not forgetting the terrible impact of mercury. Various Indigenous communities independently of the Association have complained about how they cannot use the water from their creeks, or eat the fish there.",
            "For its part the Association criticised the government for not doing enough to reduce the incidence and scale of mercury methylation into the environment and food chain, as well as undertake the remedial action the situation merited. It wrote that while regular inspections were required and there were stringent penalties for pollution on the books, these were ignored because of the understaffing at GGMC.",
            "The Association did discuss the restoration of mining sites, describing how a few years ago the GGMC conducted an experiment to find out how much it would cost to restore a mine site on a small scale. The estimate was $6 million, which would have undoubtedly increased today. Yet the obligatory environmental bond for restoration is a \u201cderisory\u201d $100,000.",
            "While as the GHRA has said, the laws and regulations should be enforced and the penalties increased, there is also the need for a massive recruitment drive to hire far more mines officers and wardens; without them nothing will happen. The Association would also like to see environmental neglect and human suffering along with bio-diversity and wildlife loss as a cost which should be added to the profits from gold mining.",
            "While that is probably unlikely to happen, what most people would like to see would be stringent measures enforced to prevent, or in some cases seriously limit the deleterious effects of mining in our hinterland. But before that can happen there would need first to be a major attitudinal change on the part of the ruling party and government, so they come to appreciate that human health, biodiversity and respect for the environment are more important than what in Shakespearean times was called \u2018filthy lucre.\u2019 There should be no more miners\u2019 comfort releases emanating from Mr Vickram Bharrat\u2019s Ministry. Instead we look forward to what he is going to say about stopping the violation of our interior."

            "Parliament clears $40.7b in supplementary financing: Just over $40.7b in supplementary financing was approved by Parliament after around 10 hours of debate last Friday and there were clashes over several of the items particularly for the sugar industry The two sides argued over contingency funds equalling $4.57 billion intended for the agriculture sector during the 85th Sitting of the National Assembly at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre. The Government requested that amount to cover expenses from April 1 to July 30, 2024, in a bid to stabilize the rice and sugar industries. Stabroek News on Wednesday reported that GuySuCo registered whopping losses of $7.8 billion in 2021 and $10.2 billion in 2022. Further, this year it had the worst-ever first crop. Despite setting an ambitious target of 100,000 tonnes for the year, insiders suggest that even a strong second crop may not suffice to meet this goal. Defending the request from the Contingency Fund, Agriculture Minister Zulfikar Mustapha also addressed concerns about the reopening of GuySuCo estates and financial management. He noted that the Albion estate has faced electrical issues, while the Rose Hall estate processed over 2,000 tonnes of sugar, generating revenue at the average price of US$750 per tonne. Despite ongoing financial difficulties, Rehabilitation efforts include a $600 million investment to repair the Albion factory powerhouse. The Guyana Rice Development Board, another crucial player in Guyana\u2019s agricultural arena, has been plunged into financial difficulties due to a temporary 25% reduction in commission rates designed to aid millers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This move, intended to stabilize paddy prices, has instead led to a severe financial shortfall, with the GRDB having to forgo its commission entirely. Paddy prices surged from $4000 to $4500 per bag between April and August 2024, exacerbating the GRDB\u2019s financial strain. As the GRDB scrambles to restore its finances, questions were raised by the opposition. \u201cWhy was $524 million suddenly needed and not in February\u2019s budget?\u201d Opposition MP Vinceroy Jordan demanded answers, questioning the unexpected financial strain and the GRDB\u2019s ability to manage its growing staff of 250. Mustapha attributed the crisis to unforeseen challenges, including a new paddy bug threat and complications from El Ni\u00f1o. With rice production holding steady, up from 610,000 tonnes to 653,000 tonnes, the sector appears resilient despite mounting issues, according to Mustapha. Yet, rising prices for white and brown rice are fueling opposition concerns. Mustapha said that the increases are\u00a0 market-driven rather than supply-related, insisting that the government cannot enforce price controls on supermarkets.",
            "Sugar",
            "GuySuCo recorded losses of $7.8b in 2021, $10.2b in 2022 \u2013 Cheong: Even as GuySuCo\u2019s audit for last year is still to be completed, projections are not bright as the corporation recorded back-to-back losses of $7.8 billion and $10.2 billion in 2021 and 2022 respectively and this year recorded the lowest first crop in its history. Newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Paul Cheong was asked by Stabroek News in an exclusive interview about losses for the period from 2021 to 2023. He provided the 2021 and 2022 figures, and disclosed that last year\u2019s books were not yet audited. The extent of the losses in the wake of large state subventions to the industry will raise further questions about the government\u2019s strategy. In its 2020 manifesto it had vowed to reopen three estates that were shuttered by the APNU+AFC administration. It has since reopened one, Rose Hall. In 2021, GuySuCo produced 57,995 tonnes of sugar and in 2022, 47,049 tonnes, while last year it was a little over the 60,000 tonne-target it had set at 60, 204 tonnes. The aim this year is an ambitious 100,000 tonnes, but with the first crop the lowest it has been in GuySuCo\u2019s history, even if the second crop is strong, meeting the target seems impossible at this time. One source with knowledge of the industry and the corporation said that \u201ceven with an optimal second crop, meeting last year\u2019s target doesn\u2019t currently seem likely.\u201d It is unclear what the corporation\u2019s production cost per pound is currently but its new CEO said that it sells both packaged and bagged sugar to CARICOM and regional countries as well as North America and Europe. \u201cPricing is based on territory and is sensitive so we will not divulge such information,\u201d he said when asked about costs.

            "Gov\u2019t needs to clarify ExxonMobil\u2019s interest payments under 2016 PSA \u2013 PNCR: The People\u2019s National Congress Reform (PNCR) has expressed worry about the inability or reluctance of the government to shed light on whether or not ExxonMobil is charging interest on its investments in the Stabroek Block and, if so, at what interest rate, and as such is calling on the administration to clarify this issue for the benefit of the Guyanese people. In a release last week, the PNCR stated its opinion that the reluctance of Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo to fully disclose information on this matter has gone beyond \u2018eye pass\u2019with it being more than likely that he himself is not on top of the situation and, worse, \u201cdoes not care to be\u2026 his disdain for his responsibilities as the PPP\u2019s oil autocrat thus represents an assault on the well-being of every Guyanese.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0It also pointed out that the matter of interest payments can potentially amount to billions of US dollars in revenue leakages, bearing in mind that given the many tens of billions of US dollars involved in developing Guyana oil fields, an interest rate of even five per cent would result in a huge expense. Such monies, it contends, could instead be used to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis, raise salaries, eradicate poverty, and meet many other urgent needs. In an effort to explain the party\u2019s concerns, the release made reference to Annex C of the 2016 Production Sharing Agreement (PSA), which states that interest expenses are recoverable without the approval of the minister, so long as they are \u201cconsistent with market rates.\u201d However, it was pointed out, the first Exxon audit, commissioned by the Coalition Government, explicitly declares on Page 4 that the company did not recover any interest expenses. It read, \u201cInterest and financing costs are recoverable under the 2016 PSA. However, EEPGL confirmed during the audit period that no interest or financing charges have been included in cost recovery- the audit team has confirmed that no interest or financing costs are included in the amount presented in the Q4 2017 cost recovery statement.\u201d Such an explicit and direct statement, the release noted, is however missing in the second Exxon Audit, commissioned by the PPP to cover US$7.3 billion in the 2018-2020 period.\u00a0 It also highlighted that because the PSA allows interest expenses to be recoverable without the approval of the minister, any audit that lacks necessary thoroughness will not automatically flag them when they appear in the cost recovery bank. This in the PNCR\u2019s view is what Jagdeo \u201cseems not to grasp (or cares not to)\u201d Explaining further, it noted that when the Stabroek Block operator says Guyana is not being charged interest on developments, therefore, an audit which follows the letter of the PSA may not directly reveal whether or not this is the case. As a result, it is, at minimum, incumbent upon the Government of Guyana to monitor quarterly expense reports to identify whether interest is being charged and to raise this issue with the operator if it are not living up to its word.",

            "AG: US DoJ has acknowledged request for info on Mohameds, Toussaint Jr. Thomas: Attorney General Anil Nandlall SC says that the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has acknowledged Guyana\u2019s request for information related to sanctions imposed on businessmen Nazar Mohamed, his son Azruddin, and Permanent Secretary Mae Toussaint Jr. Thomas. However, the Attorney General indicated that obtaining the requested details will take some time. In June, the government was advised by Washing-ton that any information concerning the sanctions against the Mohamed family and Toussaint Jr. Thomas would need to be obtained through the DoJ. Following the sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on June 11, the Guyanese government contacted U.S. authorities to request information that would support its investigation into the affected individuals. These requests were sent by Minister of Finance Dr Ashni Singh and the Commissioner General of the Guyana Revenue Authority, Godfrey Statia under the Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) between Guyana and the U.S. The TIEA allows for the exchange of information to enforce tax laws, prevent fraud, and ensure accurate tax assessments. The government anticipates that both the mutual legal assistance process and the TIEA will enable timely and effective information sharing. Singh emphasized that the government will continue to work diligently with U.S. counterparts to resolve this matter swiftly. The sanctions under the US Magnitsky Act created a furore here and underlined that Washington was looking closely at major players allegedly involved in corruption. Use of the Magnitsky Act usually denotes very serious concerns about the targets. On June 11, the United States Department of The Treasury imposed sanctions on the\u00a0 Mohameds over the alleged massive smuggling of gold. Toussaint Jr Thomas, was cited for alleged corruption leading to her being immediately sent on leave by the government here. Allegations against the Mohameds include defrauding the government here of some US$50 million in taxes from smuggled gold, as well as bribing public officials. For Toussaint Jr Thomas\u2019s part, it said that she used her office while serving at the Ministry of Home Affairs, to offer benefits to the Mohameds that included contracts, licences for weapons, and passports.",
            "Gov\u2019t doing little to address negative impacts of gold mining \u2013 GHRA: The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) is taking the government to task for failing to insulate the environment and Indigenous communities from the negative effects of gold mining and makes the case that the many benefits it accords the sector do little to encourage responsible action. In a release last week, GHRA referenced the recent statement from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MoNR) which catalogued the extensive perks, concessions and privileges extended to the gold-mining sector, including tax reductions, duty-free concessions, simplified licensing arrangements, expansion of available mining properties in conflicted areas such as Marudi Mountains, and removal of protective regulations. All this, the Association added, without mentioning the \u201chuge environmental and human cost\u201d perpetrated by this industry. It was noted too that the ministry\u2019s statement concluded with a reminder that this unwavering support was \u201cin keeping with the ruling party Manifesto prior to the last elections.\u201d Further, the GHRA bemoaned the fact that even road-building in interior regions has become mining-driven rather than influenced by community or environmental considerations. \u00a0\u00a0The release pointed out that since all mining has a significant effect on the environment, the Environmental Protection Act 1996, (Section 11) and Schedule 4, (item 9) mandates that Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Environmental Permits (EP) are to be undertaken for each and every mining operation. However, according to the annual reports of the Guyana Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (GY-EITI), the Guyana Geology & Mines Com-mission (GGMC) has not enforced such requirements for many years for the thousands of small-scale mining claims or medium-scale mining permits covering millions of hectares. \u00a0GHRA lamented the fact that most of Guyana\u2019s prized large rivers have been reduced to health and safety hazards by gold mining, with river banks and the actual course of rivers having been altered by illegal hydraulic mining. Added to this is the failures to apply the several GGMC Codes of Practice to the waste in mine tailings now spilling polluted sediment into the creeks and rivers. \u201cNo effort has been made to apply penalties for these transgressions despite the fact that River Navigation Act (cap. 50:01, 1998) and the State Lands Act 1903/1972 (Section 22) states \u2018Everyone who willfully causes any impediment to the free use or navigation of any river or navigable creek, shall be liable to a fine of ninety-seven thousand five hundred dollars, unless he has previously obtained permission under this Act or the Forests Act to cause the impediment.\u2019\u201d",

            "US Trade Representative underlines food safety on issue of catfish exports: A block on catfish exports from Guyana to the US remains in place and Washington\u2019s Trade Representative Katherine Tai has emphasised the importance of food safety standards. In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Stabroek at the US Embassy, the US Trade Representative addressed several issues affecting trade relations between the United States and Guyana. One significant concern has been the inability of Guyanese farmers to export catfish to the United States since 2017, a situation attributed to new regulations. When questioned by this newspaper about whether this was not a case of a non-tariff barrier that discriminates against small countries like Guyana, Ambassador Tai addressed the nature of the regulations. \u201cI appreciate the opportunity to explain this matter\u2026The process we\u2019re going through regarding the imports of catfish from Guyana is part of a food safety exercise. It should not be viewed as a non-tariff barrier aimed at excluding Guyanese catfish because of the country\u2019s size. Instead, it reflects our legitimate regulatory responsibility to ensure that all imports meet our food safety standards\u201d, she said. Tai elaborated on the importance of sanitary and phytosanitary policies, which are designed to ensure that food products are safe for consumption. \u201cThis is a critical aspect of trade policy, governed by evidence and science. I understand that the review process can be frustrating, especially for producers who are very good at producing their product. However, it\u2019s vital for governments to guarantee that the food supplied to our citizens is safe. Establishing trust and confidence in the regulatory systems of different countries is crucial for maintaining food safety,\u201d she explained. Efforts to lift the US export ban on Guyanese catfish, which has been in place since September 2017 have been ongoing and it is unclear why the Department of Fisheries and the Ministry of Agriculture have yet been unable to settle the issue.\u00a0 The ban has significantly impacted the local catfish industry, particularly the export of \u2018gilbaka\u2019.",

A 2.5MW control panel and interbus transformer panel and switch gears were also damaged. However, Cheong said that by the end of March they were rebuilt and testing showed no adverse effects. He informed that \u201cfull load testing with the entire factory operational will be done on the commencement of the crop. We don\u2019t foresee any difficulty. Despite the fire, we were able to grind all of Albion\u2019s cane at the Rose Hall Factory.\u201d With 8,179 persons in the corporation\u2019s employ, he said that \u201cthere are 5,368 field workers out of an establishment of 7,600.\u201d Given the 2,232 persons deficit, he said that the corporation has intensified mechanisation to help mitigate this. And mechanisation, he underscored, was a big part of the future for GuySuCo as there are plans to adapt the industry so it can be developed\u00a0 to meet the changing global times. \u201cGuySuCo has no choice but to have its cultivation, in keeping in line with other sugar producing countries,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cThe appropriate machines and equipment are used and 40% of GuySuCo is mechanised. Not included in this 40% is Skeldon, with 5,000 hectares fully mechanised.\u201d Given that President Irfaan Ali has spoken about cultivating more cane at Skeldon, Cheong was also asked a number of questions about that factory during the interview.",

Some passengers who were stranded at Enmore, Estate Road, East Coast Demerara. Even before 7 am there was a long line from Coldingen on the embankment and even more chaos was created as some vehicles sought to turn around to escape the line and this created hardship for those who were travelling in the opposite direction. And as vehicles attempted to make it to the main road at various points the traffic came almost to a standstill. Workers gathered on the road from about 7 am and stood for hours while several drivers en route to Golden Grove, Victoria and Anns Grove emptied their buses and refused to travel back to Georgetown. The traffic buildup lasted for hours. While taxis seemed to be an alternative for others to make their way to work, they were forced to wait for hours in the traffic. After bus drivers signalled that they were not going to Georgetown, some people decided to call taxis but were told that none was available. People gathered at street corners as they waited in vain for a bus to arrive to be transported to Georgetown.\u00a0 Persons living along the railway embankment utilized the Enterprise Road to gain access to the public road but also came into contact with other drivers who diverted from the traffic at Enmore, Estate Road.",

Reports are that one suspect is in custody while police are looking for the other. According to the police, Sukhdeo was robbed of his black Toyota Allion, PWW 455, three cell phones including one Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, and a shoulder bag with a small amount of US and Guyana currency.

Many older structures still rely on outdated electrical systems, creating serious fire hazards.

            "It is of grave concern to me, as it should be to all citizens, that Guyana Water Incorporated has recently embarked on a pipe laying project on High Street which has resulted in the excavation of the road from Croal Street to Broad Street. This project is still ongoing and has resulted in extensive destruction to the road itself, massive and extended inconvenience to the flow of traffic, a drastic increase in the amount of dust and sand along the street which is posing a health hazard to hundreds if not thousands of people daily, and numerous safety hazards to commuters along the street.",

The disregard for safety has been one of my main concerns as I\u2019ve continuously witnessed poor health and safety practices by GWI that could result in serious injury or death to those who travel through the construction area.",

            "Guyana celebrated Labour Day on Thursday, May 1st, 2025. This national holiday is intended to commemorate the accomplishments of trade unions and the labour rights \u2013 including occupational safety and health rights \u2013 recognised, attained, and protected over the years.",
            "This said, Guyana\u2019s rapid oil-driven economic development has witnessed a monumental increase in public and private projects. Public works include the new Demerara Harbour Bridge, a deep-water port in Berbice, various road construction and repair initiatives, and the gas-to-energy project. Private works encompass multiple offshore development projects, including the operations of the accompanying floating production storage and offloading vessels and the construction of numerous hotels.",
            "Given these developments, it is appropriate to examine some of the rights employees have under Guyana\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Act, Cap 99:10, Laws of Guyana (OSHA), particularly since Minister of Labour Joseph Hamilton stated that 2024 saw a 45% increase in workplace fatalities compared to 2023. The increased fatalities were attributed to increased activity in the mining sector.",
            "Breaking down OSHA",
            "Employers have a fundamental duty to create and maintain a safe working environment. This includes ensuring that equipment, machinery, chemicals, biological agents, and the general work environment do not pose health risks (see sections 46[2] and 47[1] of OSHA). Employers must also implement prescribed safety measures and procedures and ensure that workers comply with these requirements (see sections 45[1] and 46[1] of OSHA). Additionally, they must provide suitable equipment, protective devices, and clothing while maintaining them in good condition (see section 46[1] of OSHA). Workers must also receive adequate training, information, and supervision to protect their health and safety (see section 46[2] of OSHA). Moreover, employers are obligated to immediately report workplace accidents causing fatalities or serious injuries to the Occupational and Health Safety Authority (a special body established under OSHA) and all other accidents within four days (see sections 69 and 70 of OSHA).",
            "Supervisors, or those in charge of workplaces or with authority over workers, play a critical role in maintaining health and safety. They must ensure that workers use protective devices and follow the prescribed safety measures (see section 48[1] of OSHA). Additionally, supervisors are responsible for informing workers about potential hazards and providing written instructions on protective measures (see section 48[2] of OSHA). They must also take reasonable steps to protect workers from harm (see section 482]).",
            "Employees bear essential responsibilities to uphold workplace safety. Workers must wear protective devices, use equipment properly, and report any defects or hazards to their employer or supervisor (see section 49[1] of OSHA). They must also care for their employer\u2019s personal protective equipment, devices, and clothing (see section 49[1] of OSHA). Workers must not remove or disable protective devices without first implementing an adequate temporary replacement. Once the need for removal no longer exists, they must immediately restore the original protective device (see section 49[2] of OSHA).",
            "Additionally, workers must avoid behaviours that could compromise safety, such as engaging in pranks, contests, feats of strength, unnecessary running, or rough conduct (see section 49[2] of OSHA). At the same time, they are entitled to critical protections. For one, employers are prohibited from dismissing, disciplining, suspending, intimidating, or penalising workers for acting in compliance with the Act or seeking enforcement of their rights (see section 58[1] of OSHA). Furthermore, workers are entitled to refuse work if they reasonably believe that equipment or workplace conditions pose an imminent and serious danger to their health or safety (see section 56[1] of OSHA).",
            "Any employer or employee who contravenes any of the provisions commits a criminal offence, whether intentionally or negligently.",
            "Ultimately, workplace health and safety is a shared responsibility. Employers, supervisors, and employees must work together to uphold the standards set out in OSHA.",
            "By understanding and fulfilling these responsibilities, we can prevent accidents, save lives, and cultivate safer work environments.",

            "Last Friday, the Policy Implementation Work-shop for the Adoption of the National Policy Guidelines for the Transportation, Storage, and Erection of Concrete Poles was held at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre. The event, which was facilitated by the Office of the Prime Minister, brought together senior officials from Guyana Power and Light (GPL), the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Housing and Water, contractors, engineers, and stakeholders to review and adopt the new framework.",
            "The policy aims to standardise procedures across the sector, improve the quality and safety of installations, and ensure long-term durability and stability. It mandates the transition of the direct burial method of traditional wooden poles to the installation of high quality concrete poles on approved foundation systems. The guidelines were drafted and refined by the technical working team from the GPL and the Miscellaneous and Urban Roads Department.",
            "Addressing the workshop, Prime Minister Mark Phillips observed that the guidelines are, \u201ctimely and necessary. Perhaps we never had such a document before, but now we have a standard from which we can demand consistency in quality.\u201d Phillips stated that the initiative is a response to frequent public complaints about the alignment and quality of utility poles, whilst noting that these structures require specialised handling due to Guyana\u2019s challenging alluvial soil and environmental conditions.",
            "Phillips called for the establishment or strengthening of an Inspectorate Department to certify works prior to final payment, stressing that such oversight is crucial to ensuring compliance. \u201cIt is not just about setting rules \u2013 it is about improving how we work together to ensure safety, reliability, and public confidence in our infrastructure,\u201d Phillips stated.",
            "\u201cWe [the Government] take the brunt of the criticism because we are elected to serve, but we need our technical teams and contractors to work to the standards set out in this policy. If we do it right, positive perception will follow,\u201d Phillips added.",
            "Whilst the government has to be commended for the development and implementation of this policy guideline for critical infrastructure, a lot more attention is required in the complementary area of labour input; namely, the monitoring and enforcement of Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) standards. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) provides detailed labour conventions, protocols, and recommendations for occupational hazards in the workplace which can affect workers\u2019 health and safety. These dangers can be categorized into six main types: biological, chemical, ergonomic, physical, safety, and work organization hazards. Each category presents unique risks, ranging from exposure to harmful substances to physical strain and psychosocial stressors. Many of these risks \u2013 most notably with regard to biological, chemical, or physical hazards \u2013 can be readily reduced by strongly enforcing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).",
            "Every day we witness glaring examples of workers being unnecessarily exposed to hazardous conditions due to the lack of PPE. Last Saturday morning, a five-man crew from Guyana Water Incorporated (GWI) was working in Fort Street, Kingston, just north of Barrack Street. Two workers descended into the sewer via a manhole, neither of whom was clad in any significant form of protective clothing. Hazard suits, breathing apparatus, safety googles, masks and gloves were all absent. The October 1997 incident where two employees of the then Georgetown Sewerage and Water Commissioners had collapsed in a manhole and were rescued by a good samaritan, appears to have been forgotten. The workers had been overcome by poisonous fumes, and it was only due to the heroic efforts of a passerby, Christopher \u2018Chrissie\u2019 Stevenson, who lost his own life as a consequence, that the unconscious men were brought to the surface, and later recovered to recount the horrific ordeal.",
            "The construction boom has brought its own bundle of potential hazards. While passing building sites in the midst of high-rise steel assembly, it is not uncommon to see workers perched on H-beams three or four storeys above the ground without a safety harness securely attached to a shock absorber and lanyard system. Equally disturbing to observe, is the delivery of sand or stone by one of the oversize trucks after it has trampled through the city. Upon arrival at the site, the driver, who will quite often block traffic in both directions by angling his vehicle across the street, will exit the cab to sneak a peek of the driveway prior to discharging the contents of the tray. During his descent, onlookers will notice the lack of a safety vest and the seemingly preferred choice of footwear, rubber slippers or sandals (to keep their feet cool?). Rubber slippers, or sandals and vehicle pedals are a recipe for an inevitable disaster.",
            "The current installation of raised concrete drains on both sides of the East Bank Demerara Road within the narrow confines of the village of Golden Grove (commonly referred to as Grove) has been a formula for chaos. As the traffic virtually claws its way along the undulating crumpled roadway, one sees many workers mixing, fetching, pouring, or plastering cement, nary a face adorned with a mask, as gusts of sand and cement dust swirl in the atmosphere. Likewise, visits to construction sites will reveal artisans cutting tiles sans safety masks (or googles), seemingly oblivious to the long-term dangers posed to human lungs by the resulting fine dust particles.",
            "These are just a few of the glaring examples one can discern on a daily basis within the city. One can only imagine what other violations of OSH standards are taking place in outlying areas where authority oversight is less likely to occur. One notable exception is the oil and gas industry (the employees are being held to foreign standards) where the workers are always smartly attired in hard hats, safety vests, steel toe boots and bright overalls.",
            "Whilst the onus is on the government to ensure compliance with the OSH protocols, the standard must be set by employers. Unfortunately, not all owners or management can be bothered that their most valuable asset, their workers, could be exposed to biological hazards such as bacteria, viruses or fungi, or chemical dangers such as pesticides and industrial materials. Presenting workers with flimsy masks and inexpensive colourful safety vests adorned with reflective stripes as is the wont of unscrupulous owners, will not suffice. All workers deserve to receive the highest standards of PPE as mandated by their respective industries. It is owed to them, and the government has an obligation to ensure that they receive same."

This reality is illustrated in the fact that even at the inception of what is expected to be a protracted process of physical across-the-country structural transformation, the fragility of Guyana\u2019s OSH regime has continually shown up through workplace accidents/tragedies, many of which are believed to have been avoidable.\u00a0",
            "With the vast extent of the country\u2019s \u2018makeover\u2019 agenda now becoming increasingly apparent, the privately-run JTW Management Training Institute Inc. continues to fashion its curriculum to respond to the extant and emerging needs of both the public and private sectors. Specifically, the range of the entity\u2019s expertise embraces corporate training, adult education and workplace development, among other specializations.",
            "At a juncture when the local construction \u2018building\u2019 sector is fashioning its own transformations to \u2018fit in\u2019 with the country\u2019s envisaged development profile, the various facets of its pursuits will require an enhanced sensitivity to considerations that embraces the upgrading of the workplace culture to place enhanced emphasis on disciplines that enhances the standing of the workplace, not least, Occupational Health and Safety.",
            "Following the staging of the country\u2019s second international investment conference staged in Georgetown earlier this month which attracted global attention, the JTW Institute has announced that it is seeking to raise awareness of the importance of OSH through a One Day Occupational Health and Safety Seminar on Thursday July 25, 2024.",
            "During previous interviews with this newspaper, Ms. Joycelyn T. Williams has contended that the extent of the growth and expansion which Guyana is now experiencing and the occupational safety and health implications that arise therefrom require an intimate knowledge of the country\u2019s OSH laws and regulations. This, she believes, will render Guyana\u2019s investment profile more universally attractive given the assurances that it will provide that critical laws governing the various aspects of workplace safety and health are not only known but strictly adhered to.",
            "\u00a0Information provided to the Stabroek Business indicates that the forum will be addressed by Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health, Earl Morris, and will allow discourse on provisions that govern the Occupational Safety and Healthy rules and practices in Guyana. The forum is designed to allow for involved interaction on issues that include understanding and applying the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health legislation; The Roles & Responsibilities of the Employer & Employees; What to do in the event of an Accident or Occupational Disease in the Workplace; Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment. \u00a0"

            "As part of its efforts to increase awareness on emerging local and international market requirements related to quality and safety of seabob products, from harvesting through to preparation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), conducted a two-day \u201cTraining of Trainers\u201d workshop for workers in the seabob sector.",
            "This was stated in a release by the FAO which noted that seabob (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri), a shrimp species harvested from the Atlantic Ocean, is one of Guyana\u2019s key exports, with the country being one of the world\u2019s leading exporters.",
            "According to the FAO release, this is the first in a series of planned trainings in this crucial area with the first cohort and comprised some 15 participants from the Fisheries Department, Ministry of Agriculture, and Pritipaul Singh Investment (PSI), a leading private sector processing firm.",
            "Key focus areas of the workshop included a deeper understanding of food safety principles, hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), the importance of food safety standards for enhancing market access, as well as strategies to further reduce waste and minimize public health risks.",
            "FAO Representative, Dr Gillian Smith, noted that this mix of public and private sector participants is important to ensure that stakeholders across the value chain have the right information to increase the opportunities for reaching new and demanding markets. Further, participation in the workshop also marks a step toward a long-term commitment to improving food handling and safety in seabob production.",
            "Meanwhile, trainers from CRFM disclosed that before the end of this year, more training will be offered to other industry stakeholders and to interested vendors and fishers. The FISH4ACP project will also assist stakeholders in developing and implementing a comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Strategy for the seabob value chain. This will help to drive a strategy to enhance safety across the industry, further reducing the risk of injury and illness to workers and fisherfolk along the seabob value chain.",
            "These initiatives are part of the FISH4ACP Programme which is implemented by FAO and the seabob industry, with funding from the European Union (EU), the release added.",
            "FISH4ACP is a five-year \u20ac40 million programme led by the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) that aims to tackle some of the underlying challenges to sustainable fisheries and aquaculture."

        "title": "Protecting informal workers from extreme heat",
        "date": "2024-08-29T02:01:38-04:00",
        "paragraphs": [
            "By Laura Alfers and Christy Braham",
            "JOHANNESBURG/WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 Today\u2019s escalating climate crisis disproportionately affects the world\u2019s two billion informal workers. As heat waves become increasingly frequent and intense, the absence of global occupational safety and health (OSH) protections against climate-related risks leaves these workers dangerously exposed. Forced to labor in record-breaking temperatures, their health and even lives are in jeopardy.",
            "In 2022, the International Labor Organization (ILO) declared a \u201csafe and healthy working environment\u201d a fundamental right. But although many countries have recognized extreme heat as an occupational hazard and implemented workplace-safety protections, these measures rarely extend to the world\u2019s most vulnerable workers: those working informally in fields, landfills, street markets, and homes.",
            "More than 2.4 billion workers worldwide are exposed to extreme heat annually. With heat stress projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades, the international community must urgently reform labor-protection frameworks to ensure workers\u2019 health, safety, and livelihoods. Without decisive action, millions will continue to suffer needlessly, trapped in a cycle of rising temperatures and hazardous working conditions.",
            "This danger is particularly acute in low- and middle-income countries, where informal jobs account for roughly 90% of total employment. While data on these workers\u2019 health and safety are limited, a growing body of research suggests that extreme heat has a profoundly negative impact on their well-being and livelihoods.",
            "For example, research by Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) and the University of Sheffield found that 85% of waste pickers in Brazil experienced heat stress in 2022 and 2023, resulting in serious health risks and reduced productivity. In Delhi, where temperatures breached 50\u00b0 Celsius in May, the death of a 53-year-old laborer prompted the lieutenant governor to issue new guidelines adjusting laborers\u2019 working hours and expanding access to drinkable water. As a recent World Health Organization editorial notes, the severe effects of extreme heat on informal workers include an increased risk of skin cancer.",
            "While discussions about protecting informal workers from heat stress often focus on outdoor laborers such as farmers and street vendors, extreme heat also affects those who work indoors in poorly ventilated spaces with limited access to potable water. In Brazil, a waste picker told WIEGO researchers that \u201cthe heat is sometimes unbearable. Being inside a shed, which has a zinc roof, affects everyone.\u201d Finding sustainable cooling solutions is also important for domestic workers and caretakers, most of whom are women.",
            "But despite recent advances on establishing global OSH standards, policymakers face significant challenges in addressing the issue. Notably, 64% of informal workers are self-employed. Without employers to finance essential safety measures, economically vulnerable workers must use their limited resources to protect themselves. As Yuleina Carmona, WIEGO\u2019s Mexico City coordinator, observed, \u201cThose who work on the street buy their own water, carry their umbrellas, wear hats, and mitigate the effects of the heat with their own resources.\u201d",
            "This weakness reflects a disconnect between local and national policymakers. In urban areas, informal workplaces are typically regulated by municipal authorities that rarely coordinate with national labor agencies responsible for workplace safety. Moreover, informal workers are often stigmatized and seen as an undesirable source of crime and urban blight.",
            "Even when national and local authorities manage to coordinate their efforts, significant gaps remain. India\u2019s heat action plans, for example, aim to tackle climate-related risks across multiple levels of government. But these plans overlook the realities of informal work and the need for targeted interventions at the municipal level, particularly in densely populated urban areas.",
            "While establishing global norms and standards is necessary, they must be translated into concrete measures that protect informal workers in the regions most affected by rising temperatures. In particular, local and municipal authorities must adopt inclusive labor regulations and invest heavily in appropriate infrastructure, including expanded access to potable water, shade, indoor ventilation, and high-quality occupational health services. To prevent the rise in morbidity and mortality rates associated with heat stress, these services must be affordable, adequately funded, and accompanied by structural shifts at the national level to provide vital income support to workers grappling with climate-related displacement.",
            "Informal worker organizations are already leading the way. In Zimbabwe, informal traders have convinced Masvingo\u2019s city council to approve public investment in critical urban infrastructure. In India, the Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association, one of the world\u2019s largest worker organizations for women in informal employment, recently launched its own insurance program that enables beneficiaries to avoid working during dangerous heat waves.",
            "In addition to such worker-driven solutions, OSH protections must be integrated into climate policies. As heat-related hazards continue to evolve and intensify, a staggering number of workers \u2013 including those in informal employment \u2013 face the risk of chronic illness, death, and disability. Without coordinated action, the future of work will be increasingly dangerous and uncertain, leaving millions of workers to face the brunt of the climate crisis.",
